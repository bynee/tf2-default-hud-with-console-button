HUD that makes the 'View Promotional Codes' button visible and changes its function to open the console.

[!IMPORTANT]
This modification was created **specifically for the default HUD**.  
Using it in conjunction with other HUDs may cause issues.

## Installation

Download this repo as a zip, extract it and place the **hud** folder in

## Default button behavior

The button would normally only be visible to players who have redeemed the RIFT Well Spun Hat Claim Code. When pressed it would open a Steam page with the redeemed codes.
